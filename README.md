             STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (C++)
===========================================================

1. PROJECT TITLE
----------------
Student Management System using C++

2. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
----------------------
The Student Management System is a console-based application 
developed in C++. It allows users to manage student records 
efficiently. The system performs operations such as adding, 
viewing, searching, deleting, and sorting student records. 
All data is stored permanently using file handling.

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), 
Standard Template Library (STL), and file handling concepts.

3. OBJECTIVES
-------------
* To understand file handling in C++
* To implement OOP concepts using classes
* To build a real-world console-based project
* To implement data management operations
* To understand sorting and searching techniques

4. FEATURES
-----------
* Add Student
* View All Students
* Search Student by Roll Number
* Delete Student
* Sort Students by Roll
* Sort Students by Name
* Duplicate Roll Number Validation
* Permanent data storage using students.txt file

5. TECHNOLOGIES USED
--------------------
* C++
* OOP (Class & Object)
* STL (vector, algorithm)
* File Handling (ifstream, ofstream)
* StringStream
* Dev-C++ / CodeBlocks

6. HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS
-----------------------
1. When program starts, it loads data from students.txt
2. User selects option from menu
3. Based on choice, system performs operation
4. After adding or deleting, data is saved back to file
5. Data remains stored even after program closes

7. MENU OPTIONS
---------------
1. Add Student
2. View Students
3. Search Student
4. Delete Student
5. Sort by Roll
6. Sort by Name
7. Exit

8. CONCEPTS USED
----------------
* Class and Objects
* Constructors
* Encapsulation
* Functions
* Vectors
* File Handling
* Sorting using STL
* Looping
* Conditional Statements
* Menu-driven Programming

9. SAMPLE OUTPUT
----------------
===== STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM =====
1. Add Student
2. View Students
3. Search Student
4. Delete Student
5. Sort by Roll
6. Sort by Name
7. Exit

10. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-----------------------
* Add Update Student Feature
* Add Admin Login System
* Add Attendance Management
* Add Marks and Grade System
* Implement Binary Search
* Convert into GUI Application

11. CONCLUSION
--------------
The Student Management System successfully demonstrates
the use of C++ programming concepts in building a 
real-world console-based application. It helps in 
understanding file handling, object-oriented programming, 
data structures, and data management techniques.
